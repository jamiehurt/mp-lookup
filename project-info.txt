A webpage which allows a user lookup who their MP is via a postcode


Developed for my final year university project 2021 using:

HTML
CSS
Javascript

----

Features:

- Lookup MP's information using a postcode api call

- Displays a portrait of the found MP

- Displays Party information and First elected date

- Displays the MP's Parliamentary and Constituency address and contact information

- Uses google charts api to show a horizontal bar chart displaying the previous election vote breakdown by party

- Shows the voting record of the MP based on the most recent Divisions

----

Plans:

- Implement the previous and next page buttons on the voting record page

- Allow for a search using more parameters such as MP name, City etc.

- Allow for a House of Lords lookup

- Show previous MP's of a Constituency

- Convert to a framework
